# todo-list

This is my TO-DO List App
This is a completed project from the Odin Project Curriculum.

This app allows you to add tasks to the dashboard, organize them by project, and delete them when you have finsihed them

This is my first finished attempt of this project.

--NOTES--

This project has taken me the longest of any other in the curriculum. It has taught me a lot about seperating funcitons into files and keeping things seperate and not too tightly coupled. 

When I began this project, I did not plan it out thourougly enough, as to be honest, I truly had no idea where to go. I was able to put something together to make it work but as I have continued the project I have thought of many ways in which to improve it.

I wanted to keep going with what I had in order to try and work with different problems. I will hopefully return and recreate this project when I have a bit more expereince under my belt and it will hopefully be a lot cleaner and a lot better structured. 

I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish with this project and even prouder of the way that I can look at it and know the things I can do/could've done to make the project better.

This version has a few bugs that I felt weren't worth correcting in its current state but would be solved if restructured. (it relies too heavily on the DOM when it should not). Additionally, this version is NOT responsive.

--original--
a basic UI and clickable buttons
have to rework bc got to focused on DOM, have to fix it to be based more on the array.
